# Resume Classification System

## Overview

The Resume Classification System is an automated tool designed to categorize resumes into pre-defined job domain classes like Data Science, Web Designing, and others. This project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and DistilBERT, to streamline the recruitment process by efficiently sorting through large volumes of resumes.

## Features

- **Automated Classification:** Quickly categorizes resumes into relevant job domains, facilitating faster recruitment decisions.
- **Advanced ML Models:** Incorporates multiple machine learning models to ensure high accuracy and adaptability to various resume formats.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload and classify resumes.
- **Detailed Analytics:** Offers insights into the classification process with detailed accuracy and performance metrics.

## Built With

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Hugging Face's Transformers
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy
- **APIs:** GloVe for Word Representation
